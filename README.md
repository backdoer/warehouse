# Warehouse

In the Divvy Manufacturing floor, we have a bunch of machines that run off of mechanical
wind power. We routinely move our machines around the manufacturing floor as new
machines come out and old ones get retired. We need to get mechanical power from the
output of our windmills to our machines through a complex network of gears. Not only does
the power have to get to the machine, but it also needs to double the RPM of the input
power by the last gear in the system.

This application provides helper functions to be able to determine the necessary gear sizes.
